# Progress

## What Works
- Project structure and directories are set up.
- Data generation module (src/data_utils.py) is fully implemented.
- Model definition (src/model.py) is implemented with configurable architecture.
- Training script (src/train.py) works with MLflow tracking.
- Hyperparameter tuning (src/tune.py) is implemented and registers the best model to the MLflow registry.
- Flask app is implemented with templates for input and result display.
- MLproject file and environment configurations are set up.
- End-to-end pipeline works, from data generation through model training and deployment.
- predict_client.py implemented for testing the API endpoint.
- Random feature generation button added to the web UI for easy testing.

## What's Left to Build
- Add more comprehensive error handling and logging.
- Implement more sophisticated model architectures (if needed).
- Add user authentication for the web interface (if required).
- Add visualization of model performance metrics in the UI.
- Containerize the application for easier deployment.

## Current Status
- Complete MLOps pipeline implemented and functional.
- Web UI is working with proper model loading from the MLflow registry.
- Fixed device compatibility issues (CUDA vs CPU) for model loading and inference.
- Added randomization feature to the web UI for easier testing.

## Known Issues
- Web application needs to be restarted manually when the model in the registry is updated.
- App requires proper module path configuration to ensure the model can be loaded correctly.
- The Flask app must be run from the correct directory to ensure proper path resolution.
