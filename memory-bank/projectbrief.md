# Project Brief

## Project Title
MLflow, PyTorch, and Flask Classification Pipeline

## Core Requirements
- Build a modular ML pipeline for classification using PyTorch.
- Use sklearn's make_classification for synthetic data generation.
- Track experiments, hyperparameters, and metrics with MLflow.
- Register the best model in the MLflow Model Registry.
- Deploy the best model via a Flask web application for real-time inference.
- Handle device compatibility (CPU/GPU) between training and inference.
- Provide intuitive UI with features for easy testing and usage.

## Goals
- Ensure reproducibility, modularity, and clarity in code and structure.
- Enable easy experiment tracking and model comparison.
- Provide a simple, user-friendly web interface for predictions.
- Demonstrate best practices for ML model development and deployment.
- Create a codebase that can serve as a template for real-world ML projects.
- Ensure the application is robust when handling model loading errors.
- Enable quick testing through random feature generation.
